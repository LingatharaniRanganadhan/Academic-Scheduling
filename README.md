# Academic-Scheduling

This project generally solves problems of class scheduling and exam scheduling in various schools worldwide. For this project, the data and problem of St. Paul's school, London Ontario, was taken. This scheduling system can be implemented in St. Paul's school directly, thereby saving a lot of time and effort. Initially, around seven research papers related to the problem were studied-the review of this literature is included in this report. In most cases nowadays, the assignment problem is solved through Hungarian algorithm; however, lately, it came into the limelight that Shortest Augmenting Path by Martello and Toth was an efficient way of solving the assignment problem. In our case, the problem set has been solved using genetic algorithm in python. The basic aim of this project is to minimize the conflicts between the schedule of classes or exams to zero. A genetic algorithm basically creates a number of generations and checks whether conflicts are removed or not. If conflicts do exist in the given generation, another generation is created by removing those conflicts and the process goes on until zero conflicts remain. The whole concept of the algorithm is borrowed from Charles Darwin's theory of natural evolution.  As, in the theory of natural evolution, the fittest individual is selected for reproduction and the offspring produced from that individual will be more fitter and have better chance of survival.
